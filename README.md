# Foundations of Algebraic Geometry

This is an English translation of Grothendieck's "Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique", translated by [Tim Hosgood](https://thosgood.com/).
The original (French) notes have been scanned and uploaded by the Grothendieck Circle [here](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/FGA.pdf).

This repository is a fork of [https://github.com/thosgood/fga](https://github.com/thosgood/fga). The original translation was written and compiled in [Forester](https://sr.ht/~jonsterling/forester/), which was designed for the unique needs of real, scalable scientific writing in hypertext. I have converted it to the more commonly used $\LaTeX$ format.
