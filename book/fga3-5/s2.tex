\section{Relations between the various relative and absolute Picard groups}\label{fga3.v-2}

\begin{proposition}\label{fga3.v-2-proposition-2.1}
    Let $f\colon X\to S$ be a morphism such that $\mathcal{O}_S\xrightarrow{\sim} f_*(\mathcal{O}_X)$.
    Then we have an exact sequence
    \[
        0
        \to \operatorname{Pic}(S)
        \to \operatorname{Pic}(X)
        \to \operatorname{Pic}'(X/S).
    \]
    If $X$ admits a section over $S$, then the last morphism is surjective, i.e. we have an isomorphism
    \[
        \operatorname{Pic}'(X/S)
        \xrightarrow{\sim} \operatorname{Pic}(X)/\operatorname{Pic}(S).
    \]
\end{proposition}


\begin{cproof}
    The exact sequence can be considered as the low degrees of the exact sequence that corresponds to the Leray spectral sequence for $f$ and $\mathcal{O}_X$.
    The second claim is equally formal.
\end{cproof}

\begin{proposition}\label{fga3.v-2-proposition-2.2}
    Let $f\colon X\to S$ be a quasi-compact separated morphism such that $\mathcal{O}_S\xrightarrow{\sim} f_*(\mathcal{O}_X)$, and let $S'\to S$ be a faithfully flat quasi-compact morphism.
    Then
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
        \item $\operatorname{Pic}'(X/S)\to\operatorname{Pic}'(X\times_S S'/S')$ is injective;
        \item If $X$ locally admits a section over $S$ (i.e. every $s\in S$ has an open neighbourhood $U$ such that $X|U$ has a section over $U$), then the diagram
              \[
                  \operatorname{Pic}'(X/S)
                  \to \operatorname{Pic}'(X\times_S S'/S')
                  \rightrightarrows \operatorname{Pic}'(X\times_S S''/S'')
              \]
              (where $S''=S'\times_S S'$) is exact.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{cproof}
    The first claim follows, thanks to the elementary properties of faithfully flat descent, from the following general remark.
    If $f\colon X\to S$ is a morphism such that $\mathcal{O}_S\xrightarrow{\sim} f_*(\mathcal{O}_X)$, then the functor $\mathcal{F}\mapsto f^*(\mathcal{F})$, from the category of locally free modules of finite type on $S$ to the category of locally free modules of finite type on $X$, is fully faithful, and its essential image is given by the modules $\mathcal{G}$ on $X$ such that $f_*(\mathcal{G})$ is locally free and such that the canonical homomorphism
    \[
        f^*f_*(\mathcal{G}) \to \mathcal{G}
    \]
    is an isomorphism.
    The second statement was proven by the theory of descent in FGA 3.I, §B.4 \Cref{fga3.i-b.4}.
\end{cproof}


The results of \Cref{fga3.v-2-proposition-2.2} can also be stated as follows:


\begin{corollary}\label{fga3.v-2-corollary-2.3}
    Under the conditions of \Cref{fga3.v-2-proposition-2.2}, the canonical homomorphism \Cref{fga3.v-1-equation-1.9} $\mathcal{P}ic'_{X/S}\to\mathcal{P}ic_{X/S}$ is injective, and even bijective if $X$ locally admits a section over $S$.
    (In the latter case, the relative Picard group $\operatorname{Pic}(X/S)$ is identified with the restricted relative Picard group $\operatorname{Pic}'(X/S)$.)
\end{corollary}

Combining this with \Cref{fga3.v-2-proposition-2.1}, we thus obtain:


\begin{corollary}\label{fga3.v-2-corollary-2.4}
    Under the conditions of \Cref{fga3.v-2-proposition-2.2}, we have an exact sequence
    \[
        0
        \to \operatorname{Pic}(S)
        \to \operatorname{Pic}(X)
        \to \operatorname{Pic}(X/S).
    \]
    If $X$ admits a section over $S$, then the last homomorphism is surjective, i.e. we have an isomorphism
    \[
        \operatorname{Pic}(X/S)
        \xrightarrow{\sim} \operatorname{Pic}(X)/\operatorname{Pic}(S).
    \]
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}\label{fga3.v-2-remark-2.5}
    Let $f\colon X\to S$ be a morphism such that $\mathcal{O}_S\xrightarrow{\sim} f_*(\mathcal{O}_X)$, and let $g$ be a section of $X$ over $S$.
    Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an invertible module on $X$.
    We define the \emph{$g$-rigidification} of $\mathcal{L}$ to be an isomorphism $\mathcal{O}_S\xrightarrow{\sim} g^*(\mathcal{L})$, and a \emph{$g$-rigidified invertible module} to be an invertible module $\mathcal{L}$ on $X$ endowed with a $g$-rigidification.
    Every automorphism of such a structure is trivial, and $\operatorname{Pic}'(X/S)$ can be identified with the set of isomorphism classes of $g$-rigidified invertible modules on $S$.
    (It is this fact that allows us to use the theory of descent to prove (ii) of \Cref{fga3.v-2-proposition-2.2}.)
    This gives a new interpretation of $\operatorname{Pic}(X/S)$, at least when $f$ is further quasi-compact and separated, so that $\operatorname{Pic}(X/S)\xrightarrow{\sim}\operatorname{Pic}'(X/S)$ by \Cref{fga3.v-2-corollary-2.3}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}\label{fga3.v-2-remark-2.6}
    Let $f\colon X\to S$ be a morphism as in \Cref{fga3.v-2-proposition-2.2}, and let $S'\to S$ be a faithfully flat quasi-compact morphism such that there exists an $S$-morphism $S'\to X$, i.e. such that there exists a section of $X'=X\times_S S'$ over $S'$.
    Let $S''=S'\times_S S'$, and $X''=X\times_S S''$, and consider the exact sequence
    \[
        \operatorname{Pic}(X/S)
        \to \operatorname{Pic}(X'/S')
        \rightrightarrows \operatorname{Pic}(X''/S'').
    \]
    Applying \Cref{fga3.v-2-corollary-2.4}, we obtain the exact sequence
    \[
        \operatorname{Pic}(X/S)
        \to \operatorname{Pic}(X')/\operatorname{Pic}(S')
        \rightrightarrows \operatorname{Pic}(X'')/\operatorname{Pic}(S'').
    \]
    In particular, every element of the relative Picard group already "comes from" an element of $\operatorname{Pic}(X')$.
    This gives a substantial simplification of the description of the relative Picard group given in the previous section, and even of the Picard functor of $X$ over $S$, since, for all $T$ over $S$, we can apply the above to $X\times_S T/T$ and to the morphism $T'=S'\times_S T\to T$.
    If, for example, $f$ itself is faithfully flat, then we can take $S'=X$, which allows us, whenever $f$ is further of finite type (resp. simple, etc.), to restrict, in the description of the relative Picard functor $T\mapsto\operatorname{Pic}(X\times_S T/T)$, to the base changes $T'\to T$ that are of finite type (resp. simple, etc.).
    If $f$ is projective and flat, and $S$ locally Noetherian, then we can prove that we can take in the above a $S'\to S$ such that $S'$ is the direct sum of \emph{flat covers} $S'_i$ of opens $S_i$ of $S$ that cover $S$;
    if $f$ is further separable, then we can take $S'_i$ to be étale over $S_i$.
